# quiz-game
This is a little project I worked on to hone my skills with python fudamentals including: operators, for loops, while loops, inputs, and general syntax. It involves creating a game that gives users the option to select which topic they would like to take a quiz on. Currently, the options are chemistry and history. After choosing the topic they want, users are given five multiple-choice questions relating to the topic of their choice. The game will let you know every time you are right/wrong, and even lets you know if you've answered multiple questions correctly consecutively.

In the future, I'd like to add 1-2 more topics. I think this will increase the variety of options which is always a great thing for the user. I would also like to add a way to count up the correct responses so it can display that against the total number of questions asked. Additionally, I would like to add a feature called "surprise me" that would randomly choose a quiz topic for the user to take.
